üåç World Economic Analysis Project

Welcome to the World Economic Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze and interpret global economic and development data, leveraging datasets from reputable sources such as the World Bank and the Human Development Index (HDI). Through this analysis, we generate insights into economic trends, human development, and other socio-economic metrics across different countries and regions over time.

üìë Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a data-driven overview of global economic and human development trends. By combining various indicators, such as GDP, inflation, life expectancy, and education indices, we gain a holistic understanding of global development. This project uses Python for data analysis and visualization, showcasing the trends and correlations across multiple dimensions of economic and social progress.

Key Objectives

	‚Ä¢	Data Aggregation: Collect and preprocess data from multiple sources to form a comprehensive dataset.
	‚Ä¢	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand data distributions, trends, and patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Visualization: Create informative visualizations that reveal key insights into economic and development indicators.
	‚Ä¢	Insight Generation: Derive meaningful insights that can support policymakers, researchers, and economists.

üìÇ Project Structure

This project consists of the following files:

	1.	**world_economic_report.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook that contains the analysis code, including data cleaning, processing, EDA, and visualization. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis process.
	2.	**WorldBank.xlsx**: This Excel file contains various economic indicators sourced from the World Bank, including:
		- GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by country and year
		- Inflation Rates
		- Unemployment Rates
		- Population Growth and other socio-economic indicators
	3.	**HDI.csv**: This CSV file contains Human Development Index data, offering insights into:
		- Life Expectancy at birth
		- Education Levels (Mean years of schooling)
		- Per Capita Income
		- HDI scores by country and year, indicating levels of human development across countries.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The project requires the following Python libraries:

	‚Ä¢	pandas
	‚Ä¢	numpy
	‚Ä¢	matplotlib
	‚Ä¢	seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/world-economic-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd world-economic-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

üìä Analysis and Visualizations

The notebook performs the following key steps:

	1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
		- Handling missing values.
		- Normalizing data formats for consistency.
		- Merging datasets on relevant keys (e.g., country and year).
	2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
		- Descriptive statistics for key economic indicators.
		- Identification of data trends and outliers.
	3. **Visualization**:
		- Time Series Analysis: Showing GDP and HDI trends over time for selected countries.
		- Cross-Country Comparisons: Visualizing economic and development disparities across countries.
		- Correlation Analysis: Understanding relationships between variables (e.g., GDP and HDI).
	4. **Insights**:
		- Top Economies: Identifying countries with the highest GDP and growth rates.
		- Human Development Trends: Exploring progress in HDI and factors affecting human development.
		- Socio-Economic Correlations: Highlighting correlations between economic indicators and development indices.
